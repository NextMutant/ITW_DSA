// Majpority elements 0
/* Why use sparse matrix-
    1.STorage: lesser non zero elements
    2.Computing Time: can be saved by logically desigining a ds traversing only non-zeros
*/

/* 2D array -
    1.Row: index of row, where non-zero elem is located
    2.Column: index of column, where non-zero elem is located
    3.Value: value of the non-zer elem located at index
